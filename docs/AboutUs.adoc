Le Duc -  was developed by the https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1/main[AY1920S1-CS2113-T16-1] team. +
_{Le Duc (The Duke in french) is for student who have multiple life and have to manage them all. Outside, they have to go to school, work part-time, attend club and have fun at some party. At home, they have to do homework, undertake a project, do some chore, cook some nice food. Pretty busy, right ? With this new tool, a student can manage and organise his time more efficiently.}_ +
