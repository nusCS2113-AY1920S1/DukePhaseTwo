=== The Product
Duke 2.0 (D2) is a desktop application that acts as an extended task manager for *prospective applicants of the various degreees offered by the NUS Faculty of Engineering*. 

D2 offers various functionalitites that range from comparing the details of two different engineering degrees, to adding and sorting these degrees into a personalised list. Moroever, as a task manager, D2 is suitable for use as a personal assistant; and lets you organise and remind yourself of important tasks pertaining to university application.

D2 specifically fits users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of an appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI). Also, if you are particularly adept at typing fast, D2 will handle your commands more quickly than traditional GUI apps.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `delete INDEX`, `` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 4`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `EVENT at/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm [to/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm]` can be used as `Mista at/04-04-2004 0444` or as `MISTA at/04-04-2004 0444 to/04-04-2004 0445`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[at/dd-MM-yyyy HHmm]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `at/04-04-2004 0444`, `at/04-04-2004 0444 at/08-08-2008 0808` etc.
