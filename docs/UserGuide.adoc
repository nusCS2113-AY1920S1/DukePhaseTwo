.. `t/ sodium` `10`
.. `{nbsp}` (The optional tag is not present)
** But not:
.. `t/calories` `{nbsp}` (The required user defined field is empty)
* Fields with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times
 ** For example, `[t/ TAG]...` can be entered as:
 .. `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times)
 .. `t/ calories`
 .. `t/ calcium t/ sodium`,  etc.
