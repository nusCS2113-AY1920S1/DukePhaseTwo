== Introduction

*Dr. Duke* is a command-line based personal assistant for doctors to manage their patients' data.

It provides house officers with a streamlined notebook environment, which allows them to concentrate on quickly and accurately
recording patient data in a standard format. If you're a house officer who types fast and doesn't mind learning how to use a
keyboard-based app to type faster, then this application is for you!

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

* *JDK 11* or above (get the latest version of Java https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]!)

=== Getting Started

. Download the latest `.jar` release file from our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-1/main/releases[release page].
. Move the `.jar` file to the folder which you want to use as *Dr. Duke*'s home.
. Double click on the `.jar` file.

*Dr. Duke* should open shortly.

== Usage

App-specific terms:

* This app manages multiple Patients. Each Patient has one or more Impressions (diagnoses), and each Impression is supported by Evidence and treated by Treatments. Evidence consists of Observations and Results. Treatments consist of Plans, Investigations and Medicine. 
* The different screens you can view are referred to as contexts. Each context is associated with a particular set of data to display.
* `priority` refers to how critical a Treatment or Evidence is. 0 means not urgent, excluding the item from the criticality system, 1 means critical. The other values are not defined specifically but the greater they are, the lower the priority. These lower priority levels are meant to remain flexible for the user to provide his desired level of fine-graining and task management.
** `priority` 1 generally refers to something that needs to be followed up on or investigated immediately, e.g. signs of severe complications. `priority` 1 items will be displayed prominently to remind the user to respond to it when treating the patient. 
* `status` refers to the stage of completion of a Treatment. The textual descriptions for each stage of completion are stored in the `statusArr` (and referred to as `<status name>`). 

Specification syntax:

* `[]` -> optional element of a command
* `<>` -> variable input, specified within bracket
* `(a|b|c)` -> input that can be one of several possible options, in this case `a`, `b` or `c`
* `"<>"` -> string, must be surrounded by quotes if it contains a space, and cannot start with a -
* `[]*` -> 0 or more of the contents of [], separated by spaces

Reused patterns:

* _patient_id_: `(<patient index>|"<part of name>"|-b <bed number>)`
* _string_or_idx_: `(<index>|"<search string>")`
** `<index>` refers to the index assigned to the object in the display. `<search string>` will be searched for in the names of all relevant objects.
* _type_: (`-m[edicine]`|`-i[nv(x|estigation)]`|`-p[lan]`|`-o[bservation]`|`-r[esult]`)

Parsing rules:

* Switches can be in any order
* Switches with optional parts of their names can be recognised with any portion of the optional part. E.g. `-crit` matches `-c[ritical]`.

== Contexts

The sections below describe what will be displayed in each context, and the commands available in them.

=== Home

Shows up to 10 numbered panels displaying a summary of the critical details of some Patients: name, bed number, primary diagnosis, and number of critical issues.

==== `help` - Display a context-specific list of commands and options [[home-help]]

Format: `help`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This will be available in every context, and will function essentially the same way, just with different commands.

==== `critical` - Display all critical observations and plans of all Patients [v2.0]

Format: `critical`

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the Patient and delete him from the system [[home-discharge]]

Format: `discharge _patient_id_ [-sum[mary] <discharge summary>]`

The discharge report will contain all information being tracked regarding the Patient, and an optional discharge summary that can be specified in the command. In v1.4, Patients will simply be deleted after the report is generated. In v2.0, they will be archived.

==== `archive` - Display discharged Patients  [v2.0]

Format: `archive`

==== `open` - Go to a more detailed view of a particular Patient

Format: `open _patient_id_ [-im[pression]]` 

If the `-b` switch is used, look up the bed number. If the `-i` switch is used, go to the impression specified by the index, or go to the primary impression for that particular Patient if no index is specified.

==== `new` - Add a new Patient to the system

Format: `new -n[ame] "<name>" -b[ed] <bed number> -a[llergies] "<allergies>" [<optional switch>]*`

Optional switches:

* `-g[o]`
* `-h[eight] <height>` 
* `-w[eight] <weight>` 
* `-ag[e] <age>`
* `-num[ber] <number>`
* `-ad[dress] "<address>"`
* `-hi[story] "<history>"`

The Patient's name, bed number and allergies must be specified. The other fields are assigned to `null` by default but can be edited later on. The `-g[o]` switch opens the Patient's context after the Patient is created.

==== `history` - Add miscellaneous notes to a patient's history [[home-history]]

Format: `history _patient_id_ "<additional notes>"`

Quickly append additional notes to a patient's history. Note that this command will only append notes - it's meant for quickly jotting down uncategorised information, not for correcting serious mistakes that need the patient's entire history section to be written.

==== `undo` - Undo the previous command [[home-undo]]

Format: `undo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

You can undo up to the last 10 commands. Only commands that affect the state of the system count against this limit (i.e. adding new Patients, editing data).

==== `redo` - Redo a command that has been undone [[home-redo]]

Format: `redo <number of commands>`

_Available in:_ <<Home>>, <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

After undoing some commands, sending any command other than `undo` or `redo` will clear the redo stack. The undone commands cannot be redone from that point onwards.

=== Patient

Shows a detailed view of a Patient, displaying in separate panels:

* All personal details
* A list of critical Treatments and Evidence (`priority` 1)
* A list of Investigations to follow up on (i.e. all current investigations; completed investigations should be stored as Results)
* Each Impression, with its name and an excerpt of its description

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<home-next,`next`>>, <<home-prev,`prev`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `back` - Go back to previous context [[patient-back]]

Format: `back`

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This will go back to the context that the user came from. A context stack will be maintained.

==== `up` - Go up to next-higher context [[patient-up]]

Format: `up`

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

This will go to the context hierarchically above the user's context. In this case, it will go back to <<Home>>. For an <<Impression>>, it would go back to the <<Patient>> associated with it.

==== `new` - Add a new Impression to this Patient

Format: `new -n[ame] "<name>" -d[escription] "<description>" [-g[o]]`

Opens the new Impression's context if `-g[o]` is specified.

==== `open` - Open a critical or Investigation item listed on the page, or an Impression

Format: `open ("<search string>"|-c[ritical] _string_or_idx_|-i[nv(x|estigation)] _string_or_idx_|-im[pression] _string_or_idx_)`

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Patient [[patient-edit]]

Format: `edit [-a[ppend]] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]*`

If `<new value>` is not supplied, open a text box with the current value loaded inside, for the user to edit. `-a` will append `<new value>` to the current value for string-valued fields. 

Switches and corresponding new value format:

* `-n[ame] "<name>"`
* `-b[ed] <bed number>`
* `-a[llergies] "<allergies>"`
* `-h[eight] <height>` 
* `-w[eight] <weight>` 
* `-ag[e] <age>`
* `-num[ber] <number>`
* `-ad[dress] "<address>"`
* `-hi[story] "<history>"`

==== `delete` - Delete a critical or Investigation item listed on the page, or an Impression

Format: `delete ("<search string>"|-c[ritical] _string_or_idx_|-i[nv(x|estigation)] _string_or_idx_|-im[pression] _string_or_idx_)`

==== `history` - Add miscellaneous notes to a patient's history

Format: `history <additional notes>`

Functionally the same as <<home-history,`history` in the Home context>>.

==== `primary` - Set a particular Impression as the primary Impression for the Patient

Format: `primary _string_or_idx_`

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria

Format: `find ["<search string>"][-im[pressions]] [_type_]* [-pri[ority] <priority>] [-sta[tus] ("<status name>"|<status idx>)]`

Display a list of all Impressions, Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search. If none of the `_type_` or `im[pression]` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed. If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

==== `discharge` - Generate a discharge report for the Patient and delete him from the system

Format: `discharge [-sum[mary] <discharge summary>]`

Functionally the same as <<home-discharge,`discharge` in the Home context>>.

==== `report` - Generate a text file containing all data on this patient [[patient-report]]

Format: `report`

Report will be generated in the format required by the hospital's internal systems. In v2.0, the hospital's required format can be specified.

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>>

==== `round` - Ward round mode [v2.0]

Format: `round`

_Available in:_ <<Patient>>, <<Impression>>, <<Treatment and Evidence>> [v2.0]

An input mode designed for maximum speed input. Only the first word of the input, which should be a sequence of control characters, will determine where the input is directed. Everything else will be treated as input.

=== Impression

Shows a detailed view of an Impression, displaying in separate panels:

* The name and full description of the Impression
* A list of Evidence for the Impression, sorted by default with critical items first
* A list of Treatments for the Impression, sorted by default with critical items first, followed by investigations that require follow-up
* A small panel with the patient's allergies

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<home-next,`next`>>, <<home-prev,`prev`>>, <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<patient-report,`report`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `new` - Add a new Treatment or Evidence item to this Impression

Format: `new _type_ <relevant switches> [-g[o]]`

Open the new Treatment or Evidence item's context if `-g[o]` is specified. Relevant switches for various types are as follows.

[[type-table]]
[cols=2*,options="header"]

|===

`<status name>` is a case-insensitive substring of the `statusArr` entry of that particular object, while `<status idx>` is its numerical representation.

==== `open` - Open a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `open ("<search string>"|-e[vidence] _string_or_idx_|-t[reatment] _string_or_idx_)`

This will open a new context for the specific Treatment or Evidence identified.

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Impression

Format: `edit [-a[ppend]] [_type_ _string_or_idx_] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

If input without `_type_ _string_or_idx_`, it is functionally the same as <<patient-edit,`edit` for Patients>>, but with different possible switches.

Switches and corresponding new value formats:

* `-n[ame] "<name>"`
* `-d[escription] "<description>"`

With this additional switch, the command instead edits an associated Treatment or Object. The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can now be found in the <<type-table,table>> for `new`.

==== `delete` - Delete a Treatment or Evidence item listed on this page

Format: `delete ("<search string>"|-e[vidence] _string_or_idx_|-t[reatment] _string_or_idx_)`

==== `primary` - Set this Impression as the primary Impression for the Patient

Format: `primary`

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move ("<search string>"|-e[vidence] _string_or_idx_|-t[reatment] _string_or_idx_) [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command. If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark a Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority ("<search string>"|-e[vidence] _string_or_idx_|-t[reatment] _string_or_idx_) -s <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status _string_or_idx_ [-s ("<status name>"|<status idx>)]`

If `-s` is not specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

==== `result` - Convert an Investigation that has been completed into a Result

Format: `result _string_or_idx_ -sum[mary] "<result summary>"`

_idx_ in this scope will refer to an index in the Treatment list. The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.

==== `find` - Find items matching certain criteria

Format: `find ["<search string>"] [_type_]* [-pri[ority] <priority>] [-sta[tus] ("<status name>"|<status idx>)]`

Display a list of all Treatments and Evidence matching the criteria specified in the search. If none of the `_type_` switches are used, all types of objects will be listed. If at least one of them is listed, only objects whose type is used as a switch will be listed.

=== Treatment and Evidence

All Treatment and Evidence contexts (one for each type of Treatment and each type of Evidence) behave in essentially the same way: they display all their data in full. This section will list the commands that they have in common. Each individual Treatment and Evidence context is assumed to have all these commands, and all the commands in this inheritance list.

Inherits: <<home-help,`help`>>, <<home-next,`next`>>, <<home-prev,`prev`>>, <<patient-back,`back`>>, <<patient-up,`up`>>, <<patient-report,`report`>>, <<home-undo,`undo`>>, <<home-redo,`redo`>>

==== `edit` - Edit one of the details of the Treatment or Evidence

Format: `edit [-a[ppend]] <switch> [<new value>] [<switch> [<new value>]]`

The possible values for `<switch>` and `<new value>` can now be found in the <<type-table,table>> for `new` in the Impression context.

==== `move` - Move a Treatment or Evidence to a different Impression

Format: `move [-im[pression] "<search string>"]`

If a Treatment or Evidence is assigned incorrectly, it can be moved to a different Impression via this command. If the `-im[pression]` switch is not used to specify the Impression to move it to, a window listing all Impressions will appear, and the user can select the correct Impression using its list index.

==== `priority` - Mark the Treatment or Evidence as a certain priority level

Format: `priority <new priority>`

`<new priority>` must be a non-negative integer.

=== Treatment

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `status` - Update the completion status of a Treatment

Format: `status [("<status name>"|<status idx>)]`

If no `<status name>` or `<status idx>` is specified, `status` will be incremented by 1, unless it is at the maximum value.

=== Investigation

Contains everything in <<Treatment and Evidence>>.

==== `result` - Convert the Investigation into a Result after completion

Format: `result -sum[mary] "<result summary>"`

The result summary will be appended to the Investigation summary.
