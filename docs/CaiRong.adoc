== Project: RIMS – Resource & Inventory Management System

This portfolio documents my contributions to the RIMS project, in terms of coding contributions towards implementing main features, project management on GitHub, and written contributions towards the User Guide, Developer Guide and general documentation.

My project team consists of 4 computing students and I. Our project is about morphing an existing command-line note-taker into a storage management application. This application is a basic command-line interface application. This morphed application aims to serve as a user-friendly book-keeping system for logistics management. 

My role was to design and program the return feature. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides about these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of the codes I have contributed, and other helpful contribution to the project.


* Created a basic structure to store reservations pertaining to each item. 

* Created the return feature, allowing users to cancel/return a borrowed resource by removing the corresponding reservation date from the storage. 

* Created 

Extensive analysis and testing has been done to ensure this feature works cohesively with other features such as reserve and storage. 


- *Return*: Remove existing reservations
 
** Description: The `return` command allows the user to return a resource by removing a specific reservation. This frees up the resource and makes it available for borrowing.

** Justification: This feature enhances the effectiveness of RIMS as a digital inventory tracker for its intended audience of resource managers, for whom has to frequently remove reservations when the borrowers return the items.

** Highlights: This feature only allows an user to remove his or her own reservations. This is to prevent accidental removal of reservations made by other users.

- *Stats*: Graphical representation of reservation
 
** Description: The `stats` command allows the user view the quantity of resources borrowed between two dates. 

** Justification: This feature gives the resource manager a rough view of how many resources are used.

- *Ohters*: Junit
 
** Description: Implemented several Junit test classes.

*** Helped with formatting and cosmetic improvements of User Guide to enhance readability

** Community:
*** Raised issues to be resolved.

== Contributions to the User Guide

Given below is an excerpt of the RIMS User Guide, featuring my contributions to the guide.

The excerpt describes the usage of the `loan` and `reserve` commands in RIMS, which are used to register the lending out of items in the user’s inventory.

=== Resource Status

==== Return a resource: `Return`
Return a loaned out resource, make it avaialable for borrowing again.

.*Format*:
. `return /id USER_ID` kbd:[Enter] +
`RESERVATION NUMBER(separated by kbd:[space])`

* If user does not exist in RIMS, or has made no reservations, then the UI will send a message to inform the user.
* If the reservation numbers are invalid, or cannot be found, then the UI will send a message to inform the user.

.*Examples*:
. `return /id 1` kbd:[Enter] +
`1  2` kbd:[Enter] + 
This removed reservation 1 and 2 made by the user.

==== Show Stats: `Stats`
Shows the number of resource borrowed per day in the form of a simple bar graph.

.*Format*:
. `stats /from DD/MM/YYYY HHMM /till DD/MM/YYYY HHMM`
* RIMS only supports date intervals of 14 or less now.
* If the dates are invalid, the UI will a send a message to inform the user.

.*Examples*:
* `stats /from 11/11/2020 1000 /till 20/11/2020`

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Given below is an excerpt of the RIMS Developer Guide, featuring my contributions to the guide.

The excerpt describes the implementation and design considerations of the `stats` and `return` commands in RIMS.

=== Return

==== Implementation

Returning a resource utilizes the following classes: the Parser and UI class will gather inputs from users. Then, these inputs will be used to retrieve and delete the relevant reservation for the resource the user is returning.

For making a return, consider the case where a user wants to return a pen and record it in RIMS.

1. When RIMS is launched, a Ui and Parser Object is instantiated.
2. Referring to Figure 4.1.1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting the user for input. He/She enters the “return” keyword which is gathered by the Ui object.
3. The user is prompted to enter his/her user ID, and the Ui object will display a list of all Reservations made by the user.
4. The user then enters a the resources to return and the reservation ID corresponding to one of the reservations given in the list of Reservations displayed to be deleted from.
5. The Parser object constructs a new ReturnCommand object with the evaluated parameters.
6. The ReturnCommand is executed, which searches for the resources in the Reservation to be deleted.  An exception is thrown if the Resources specified are not present in the Reservation, the reservation ID provided by the user is not valid, or the Resources are only reserved and not loaned out yet.
7. After the relevant Resources have been deleted from the Reservation, the Ui object sends a message to the user notifying him/her about the success return of the Resources.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect: How return is executed_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*: Choosing which Resource to return based on Reservation and User ID
** Advantages: For multiple resources of the same instance borrowed, the user gets to decide which resource to return first (return a pen borrowed earlier, so as to return another pen due later).
** Disadvantages: The user has to choose a Reservation rather than just specifying the Resources to return.

* *Alternative 2*: Choosing which Resource to return based on User ID only
** Advantages: Less user input is required to return Resources.
** Disadvantages: Returning Resources will take a longer period to search all Reservations, and the user has less flexibility in returning Resources.

=== Stats

==== Implementation

Generating stats between two dates uses the following classes: the Parser and UI class will gather inputs from users. Then, these inputs will be used to retrieve and delete the relevant reservation for the resource the user is returning.

For making a return, consider the case where a user wants to return a pen and record it in RIMS.

1. When RIMS is launched, a Ui and Parser Object is instantiated.
2. A parseInput() function is called, prompting the user for input. He/She enters the "stats /from DATE /till DATE" input.
3. The Parser object constructs a new ReturnCommand object with the given dates.
4. The StatsCommand is executed, which finds the number of resources in use every day within the given date interval.
5. The Ui object then prints out these data in the form of a bar graph.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect: Representation of data_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*: Each borrowed resource is indicated by a '==' in the bar graph.

** advantages: Easier to read as compared to densely populated list of numbers.

** disadvantages: Not ideal if the user wishes to find out exactly how many resources are in used one day.

* *Alternative 2*: Display number beside each date.

** advantages: Easier to see the number of resources in used per day.

** disadvantages: More difficult to tell the change in trend.
