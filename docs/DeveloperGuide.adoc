=== Non Functional Requirements

. *Computer environment*: should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
. *Persistence*: the total logistics list should be retained upon termination of RIMS.
. *Ease of use*: Program functions should be easy and convenient to use.
. *Quality requirement*: The system should be efficient enough for the user to quickly update and keep track of the facilities and items under their care.
. *Speed*: Program should execute commands efficiently and without lag.
