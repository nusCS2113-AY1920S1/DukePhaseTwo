== Introduction

*ModPlan*

ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelorâ€™s degree.  +
ModPlan is currently only designed to work for Computer Engineering students, and the requisite modules for graduation. +
ModPlan uses NUSMODS API to extract official module data from the NUS Registrar's Office. + 
This Developer Guide is meant for any software developer who wishes to contribute to or test ModPlan, and can find architecture, implementation methods and high-level design considerations within this file.

== Setting up

**Prerequisites**

* JDK version:  `11` or above
* Recommended IDE: `IntelliJ IDEA`
* Fork this repo to your GitHub account and clone the fork to your computer

**Importing the project into IntelliJ**

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
2. Set up the correct JDK version.
   * Click `Configure` > `Structure for new Projects` (in older versions of Intellij:`Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`).
   * If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11.
   * Click `OK`.
3. Click `Import Project`.
4. Locate the project directory and click `OK`.
5. Select `Create project from existing sources` and click `Next`.
6. Rename the project if you want. Click `Next`.
7. Ensure that your src folder is checked. Keep clicking `Next`.
8. Click `Finish`.

**Running the Project**

*If you are not using `gradle`, simply locate the `Duke.java` file under `PROJECT_DIRECTORY/src/main/java/Duke.java`, and run it in your IDE.

*If you are using `gradle`, import the project as a gradle project using the `Import Gradle Project` function in IntelliJ, and run `Duke.java` from the Gradle toolbar.

== Use Cases

=== Use Case: Adding modules to user's timetable
Actor: NUS CEG Student

1. User inputs the module code
2. ModPlan shows the module information to the user, such as description, number of MCs, prerequisite modules etc. and requests confirmation from the user to add this module
3. User confirms they want to add the module 
4. ModPlan shows the non-clashing available timings of the module to the user
5. User confirms which class timing they wish to add to their timetable
6. ModPlan adds that specific class to the user's timetable, and prints the user's updated timetable +
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

2a. If the module is a Level-1000 module, ModPlan checks for the user's current number of Level-1000 modules taken +
2b. If the limit is not exceeded, proceed to step 3 +
2c. If the limit will be exceeded, warn the user, and prevent addition of the module +
Return to step 3.

=== Use Case: Viewing graduation requirements
Actor: NUS CEG Undergraduate Student

1. User inputs their course name
2. ModPlan shows the courses that match the user's input
3. User selects the correct course they wish to check graduation requirements for
4. ModPlan displays all the modules required for graduation, and lists the number of MCs required for graduation +
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

3a. User can input the modules they have taken already that count towards graduating that course
3b. ModPlan will exclude these modules from the list and MC count +
Return to Step 4.

=== Use Case: Viewing class and CCA timetable
Actor: NUS Student

1. User inputs the command to `view timetable`
2. ModPlan shows the user their current timetable, including class and CCA timings

[appendix]
== Non-Functional Requirements

1. ModPlan should run on any machine with JDK `11` and above installed. 
2. ModPlan should be fast to view and input commands.
3. ModPlan should require as few steps as possible for the user to do what they want to do.
