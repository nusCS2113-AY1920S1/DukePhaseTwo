== Introduction

Welcome to the *Dr. Duke* developer guide! This document assumes a familiarity with the link:UserGuide.adoc[user guide].

In order to be a successful *Dr. Duke* developer, you need a general understanding of: +

* *Dr. Duke*'s architecture and object model
* The Java framework which *Dr. Duke* builds on

== Setting up
=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+

NOTE: IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +

This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

*House officers*, who are typically freshly-graduated medical students, play a vital role in managing hospital patients.
They are responsible, among many other things, for collating all information regarding each hospital patient and
organising it to provide a clear picture of the patient's situation, and for presenting that picture to senior doctors
who can then make assessments and recommendations based on that picture. As much of this information needs to be
exchanged at a rapid pace, *Dr. Duke* assists in quick, accurate and efficient recording and retrieval of the patient
data required to provide effective care.

The house officers we are targeting with this app:

* need to manage a significant number of patients
* need to quickly input and organise patient data
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* prefer typing over mouse input
* can type fast

*Value proposition*:

* input, organise and access information about patients faster than with a typical mouse/GUI driven app

  or they fail and the user is notified of that event, with the data being unchanged.
