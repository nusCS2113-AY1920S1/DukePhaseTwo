== Introduction
=== Purpose

This document illustrates on the architecture designs and the software decisions implemented for the desktop application D2. Duke 2.0 (D2), or Duke Jr.? is a desktop application which enables the prospective applicants of NUS Faculty of Engineering to better plan out their university life. It is an extended task manager, which not only allows for prospective applicants to manage their deadlines and events pertaining to the freshman orientations and document submission, but also provides a coherent and concise platform to compare two engineering degrees of their choice and explore many other details related to the degree. Students can also create lists of engineering degrees of their choice and update it as per their choice. The developer guide will provide you with information such as an overall view of the system hierarchy, logical view of the system’s components, and a process view of the system’s communications that will enable you to help contribute to it too. 

=== Scope

This document describes the software architecture and various other software decisions undertaken for the implementation of D2. The intended audience of this document are developers, designers, software testers of D2 and for those who wish to modify the source files to fit for their own purposes. You may also have a look at it if you wish to understand how this application works.

== Setting Up
=== Prerequisites
While Duke 2.0 may work using diffferent versions of Java and with other IDEs, the following are recommended because they have been used for testing:

* Java Development Kit '11'
* Intellij IDE

=== Setup on local Computer


*Manual Import:*

. `Fork` this Repository and `Clone` your remote repository locally to your computer
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate project directory of the cloned repository
. Click `Next`
. Ensure that the `src folder` is checked ✅, and Click `Next` until the `Finish` button appears
. Click the `Finish` button


*Automatic Import using Intellij Check Out:*

. `Fork` this Repository
. Open *Intellij IDE* and set up JDK `11`
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` > `JDK` and select the path of the installed JDK `11`
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Check out from Version Control` > `Git`
. Enter URL of your remote repository > Click `Clone`
. Wait for Intellij to Set Up the project


=== Verifying Setup
. Ensure that Gradle has been imported by running `src/java/javafx/Launcher.java`
. Test out basic Duke 2.0 commands by referring to the User Guide
