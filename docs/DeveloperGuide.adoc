== Design
=== Architecture
.General Architecture Diagram for RIMS
[caption="Figure 1.1: "]
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

The architecture diagram above is an abstracted high-level representation of the workings behind the RIMS software.
There are a total of 5 main components within RIMS, and outside of RIMS, a single *User*, as well as *Text files* for
data persistence.

The main components are listed below, with  a brief description and overview of their scope:

* <<Model component,Model>>: The structure of RIMS, complete with resource and reservation details.
* <<Ui component, Ui>>: The main user interface that the user interacts with to enter his/her input and receive updates and messages
from RIMS itself.
* <<Logic component,Logic>>: The mechanism which makes sense of the input given by Ui and subsequently
executes the relevant commands within RIMS.
* <<Storage component,Storage>>: Reads data from, and writes data to the external *Text files*.
* <<Exception component,Exceptions>>: Custom RIMS exceptions that may be raised from contextual errors while executing
commands in RIMS.

Note: In order to declutter the class diagrams shown below, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for attributes
in classes are omitted.

=== Model component
.Class Diagram for Model component
[caption="Figure 1.2: "]
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="1000", align="center"]
_Classes involved: Resource, Item, Room, ResourceList, ReservationList, Reservation, DateRange_

The Model component forms the backbone of the RIMS software and is the structure to inventorise Resources and manage
their loans. With reference to Figure 1.2,The RIMS structure comprises a single large ResourceList, which is an ArrayList
of Resource objects with various custom methods to make changes in accordance to commands.

==== The Resource Class

A resource is represented by the Resource class, with basic attributes such as
its name and its type (Room or Item represented by an enumeration) are inside. An enumeration ResourceType is used to
represent types of resources so that more can be accomodated in the future. Classes Room and Item are inherited classes
from Resource.

==== Reservation class and resourceId attribute

The more important attributes of a Resource object is the resourceId and its Reservations, recorded in a ReservationList. Firstly, the resourceId
is an integer to identify a single unique Resource. For example, if RIMS has two pens, which were borrowed for different
durations by different users, I would need to be able to identify which one is available when a third user wants to
borrow one again.

This leads to the second important attribute which is the ReservationList, which is an ArrayList of
Reservation objects. A Reservation object contains details of a loan or reservation, such as the identity of the borrower
(borrower_id), the unique identifier for that particular loan (reservation_id) to identify multiple unique Resources
borrowed, and lastly a custom DateRange object to identify the duration for which the Resource is being borrowed.

The DateRange class contains functions to typecast the dates into a specified format of String type for passing to Ui
as a message to the user.


=== UI component
.Class Diagram for UI component
[caption="Figure 1.3 "]
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="200", align="center"]

_Classes involved: Ui_

The Ui class fulfills two purposes, as shown in Figure 1.3:

1. Taking in input given by the user.
2. Sending messages to notify the user.

For the first function, the Ui class contains a Scanner object to take in user input, as well as an input of String type to process it via the
Logic component as a valid command/instruction.

For the second function, the Ui class has functions to print out user messages in a specific format. Examples include
printHome(), which is the welcome message when launching RIMS, as well as printFarewell(), which is
the message sent to the user upon termination of RIMS.

=== Logic component
.Class Diagram for Model component
[caption="Figure 1.4: "]
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="1000", align="center"]

_Classes involved: Parser, Command and its inherited classes_

The logic component is shows how user instructions are managed in RIMS. The Parser class receives input from the Ui,
then parses it (using parseInput function) to identify the type of Command it is. After identifying the type of Command,
Parser then evaluates the relevant parameters required and constructs the corresponding Command. Following that, the
Command's execute method is called to carry out the instructions.

==== The Command class

Referring to Figure 1.4, the Command class is an abstract class with two main parts that are crucial for all inherited
Command classes.

Firstly, since the main program runs on a loop to evaluate user inputs repeatedly for commands, it needs to know
when to terminate. The Boolean attribute exitCode is inherited in every subclass of Command, and helps the main program
to check if the Command is a CloseCommand, a special Command which instructs RIMS to terminate.

Secondly, the execute method is an abstract method that applies to all Commands in the RIMS system.

1. Using the parameters
evaluated in Parser, it interacts with the Model component to make the necessary checks/updates to RIMS
2. A formatted message is to the user about the outcome via Ui
3. If necessary, data is saved to external files using the Storage component.

=== Storage component
.Class Diagram for Model component
[caption="Figure 1.5: "]
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="300", align="center"]

_Classes involved: Storage_

The Storage class ensures data persistence upon termination of RIMS and is the intermediary between the external files and
the Model component. Before discussing its attributes and methods, refer to Figure 1.5 to see where and how data in RIMS is saved
and loaded.

==== External files
Data in RIMS is saved and loaded from two main text (.txt) files.

* resources.txt: Contains the current list of resources that are recorded by RIMS, regardless of their status (excluding the
details of resources' reservations)
* reservations.txt: Contains the list of reservations and their details for every resource listed in RIMS.

==== Storage attributes and methods (Loading and Saving)

Loading and saving to/from the above mentioned external files are vital for Storage to function. In order to do both,
Storage has attributes of File type which records the paths to the local external files. There is also a temporary
ArrayList of Resources to retrieve and store data from the Model component.

For loading from files, we need to read both external files mentioned above, so dedicated methods for resources.txt and
reservations.txt are present (as readResourceFile() and readReserveFile()).

As mentioned before in the Model component, Reservations are integrated into each Resource, therefore when saving into
external files, we only need one method saveToFiles().

=== Exception component
.Class Diagram for Model component
[caption="Figure 1.6: "]
image::ExceptionClassDiagram.png[width="500", align="center"]

_Classes involved: RimsException and all inherited classes_

RimsException is a custom Exception class to catch all errors presented by contextual problems occuring within RIMS
that basic Exceptions will miss. The overarching idea behind this component is that RIMS should not terminate under any
other circumstances other than by means of the CloseCommand (as mentioned in the Logic Component).

The basic RimsException class contains a String describing the type of error that has been occurred, and has a method to
send a formatted output to the user notifying him/her about the error that has occurred.

Current subclasses of RimsException are ParserException and ResourceException, but are not limited to these as there may
be other aspects which have errors that have not been identified.

==== ParserException

ParserExceptions are called when the Parser receives an invalid input. For instance, when the user is prompted for the type
of resource specified, and he/she inputs "people", a ParserException should be raised. This is because the type of Resource
specified does not belong to any that RIMS support, which are "item" and "room".

They are mainly handled by prompting the user to re-input a valid format of the required information.

==== ResourceException

These Exceptions are mainly handled when internal operations within the Model or Logic component have problems. For example,
user inputs like the duration to borrow a resource is valid, but the resource might still be on loan. As such, a
ResourceException is called.

They are mainly handled by sending a message to the user to notify them on the problem with the particular Resource.

== Implementation

=== Add/Delete

Implemented by: Sean +
Written by: Sean

==== Implementation
.Sequence Diagram for Add
[caption="Figure 2.1.1: "]
image::AddSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

Adding and deleting resources from RIMS are facilitated by the AddCommand and DeleteCommand classes respectively, after receiving input from the user in the Ui and being passed through Parser.
For adding resources, consider the case where the user wants to add a pen to RIMS.

1.	When starting up RIMS, a Ui and Parser object is instantiated respectively.
2.	Referring to Figure 1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting for input from the user. He/She types the relevant input, such as that the pen is of Item type, to the Ui object (getInput() function).
3.	This input is received by the Parser object, which contains the relevant parameters (the Parser object also prompts for new input from user should the format be incorrect).
4.	Following that, the Parser object identifies (through ReadAddCommand()) and constructs a new AddCommand with the evaluated parameters.
5.	Afterwards, the AddCommand is executed with the execute() function, which constructs a new Resource based on the parameters provided in AddCommand, adds this Resource to the existing ResourceList in RIMS (through AddResource()). This step is repeated for the quantity (specified by <QTY>) of that particular Resource that is required to be added, as specified in AddCommand.
6.	Lastly, the Ui object prints a message to the user to notify him/her of the resources that have been added into RIMS.

For deleting resources, the steps are largely the same, however, there are more errors to identify during execute() (refer to Figure 2.1.1). For instance, should the specified resource to be deleted not exist, Ui will print a message to notify the user. Also, should the specified resource to be deleted be on loan at the moment, UI will also send a message to the user to notify him/her of such.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect 1: How Resource objects are added_

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: ResourceList adds a single Resource object created in AddCommand into list
** Advantages: Follows contextual situation (recording object by object on an inventory book using paper and pen)
** Disadvantages: Requires multiple calls to add multiple objects
* *Alternative 2*: ResourceList creates a single Resource object to add, given its details, and adds it into list
** Advantages: Do not have to create Resource object in AddCommand
** Disadvantages: ResourceList must create a new Resource to add to list
* *Alternative 3*: ResourceList has function to add/delete all Resources with a user specified quantity
** Advantages: Only requires one function call in AddCommand.
** Disadvantages: Since all resources are added in ResourceList, limited information about each unique resource added can be extracted for sending the message to the user

_Aspect 2: How Resource objects are deleted_

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: ResourceList deletes a single Resource object from the list using its resource ID
** Pros: Identifies unique Resource to be deleted using its resource ID
** Cons:  May have unnecessary iteration by checking resource IDs of other Resources that are not of the same type
* *Alternative 2*: ResourceList deletes a single Resource object, given its name from the list
** Pros: Delete any Resource that corresponds to the given name
** Cons: Cannot pinpoint a unique Resource object to delete

=== Reserve/Loan

Implemented by: Bobby/Abhijit +
Written by: Bobby/Sean

==== Implementation
.Sequence Diagram for Reserve
[caption="Figure 2.2.1: "]
image::ReserveSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

Making a reservation utilizes the following classes. The Parser and UI class will gather inputs from users. Then, these inputs will be used to create new reservation under the ReserveCommand class. New reservations are added to the ReservationList class under each Resource object.

For making a reservation, consider the case where a user wants to make reservation of an existing resource.
When starting up RIMS, a Ui and Parser object is instantiated respectively.

1. Referring to Figure 2.2.1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting for input from the user. He/She enters the relevant input which is gathered by getinput() from Ui object.
2. After selecting a type of Resource, The Ui object will display a list of all Resource belong to that type for the user to choose.
3. The user can then enter the name of the Resource they wish to make a reservation for.
4. Then, the user can choose a time period they wish to reserve.
5. Following that, the Parser object constructs a new ReserveCommand object with the evaluated parameters.
6. Afterwards, the ReserveCommand is executed with the execute() function, which constructs a new Reservation based on the parameters provided in ReserveCommand.
7. The execute() function checks if an object is available for loan. If no Resource object is available, then an exception is thrown.
8. If any Resource is available for loan, then a new reservation object will be instantiated and added to the ReservationList object belonging to this Resource.
9. Lastly, the Ui object prints a message to the user to notify him/her of the resources that have been added into RIMS.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect 1: Selection of resource and quantity_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*:
User select in terms of the following sequence - resource type, resource name, resource quantity.
When each input is gathered, the ui class will feedback relevant information to help the user make decisions. In case of invalid input (such as invalid name), the parser will throw an exception and display an error message. Using this approach, users can only make one reservation for multiple resources of the same name at a time.
** Advantages: More user friendly as user only requires one single command to make reservations for multiple resources of the same name.
** Disadvantages: More difficult to catch exceptions. User also cannot select the exact resource they wish to borrow since resources are selected by a non-unique attribute.

* *Alternative 2 (Previous version)*:
User select in terms of the following sequence - resource type, resource id.
When parser starts gathering input, it will display a full list of all resources. User then select the resource to make a reservation for by entering a resource id. Using this approach, users can only make one reservation for one resource at a time.
** Advantages: Easy to handle command and catch exceptions.
** Disadvantages:
Less user friendly in handling bulk reservation as user has to repeatedly enter the same command multiple times.
Less user friendly when the resource list becomes long. Users then have to manually find a resource ID

_Aspect 2: Selection of reservation dates_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*:
User enters a single pair of start date followed by an end date. These pair of dates will be checked in the ReserveCommand class.

** Advantages:
-

** Disadvantages:
Users may need to key in repeated commands if they wish to make different reservations for a resource.

* *Alternative 2*:
Users are able to enter a list of pairs of start date followed by an end date. These pair of dates will be checked in the ReserveCommand class

** Advantages:
More user friendly if users wish to make different reservations for a resource.

** Disadvantages:
-

=== Return

Implemented by: Bobby/Abhijit +
Written by: Bobby/Sean

==== Implementation

Returning a resource utilizes the following classes: the Parser and UI class will gather inputs from users. Then, these inputs will be used to retrieve and delete the relevant reservation for the resource the user is returning.

For making a return, consider the case where a user wants to return a pen and record it in RIMS.

1. When RIMS is launched, a Ui and Parser Object is instantiated.
2. Referring to Figure 2.3.1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting the user for input. He/She enters the “return” keyword which is gathered by the Ui object.
3. The user is prompted to enter his/her user ID, and the Ui object will display a list of all Reservations made by the user.
4. The user then enters a the resources to return and the reservation ID corresponding to one of the reservations given in the list of Reservations displayed to be deleted from.
5. The Parser object constructs a new ReturnCommand object with the evaluated parameters.
6. The ReturnCommand is executed, which searches for the resources in the Reservation to be deleted.  An exception is thrown if the Resources specified are not present in the Reservation, the reservation ID provided by the user is not valid, or the Resources are only reserved and not loaned out yet.
7. After the relevant Resources have been deleted from the Reservation, the Ui object sends a message to the user notifying him/her about the success return of the Resources.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect: How return is executed_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*: Choosing which Resource to return based on Reservation and User ID
** Advantages: For multiple resources of the same instance borrowed, the user gets to decide which resource to return first (return a pen borrowed earlier, so as to return another pen due later).
** Disadvantages: The user has to choose a Reservation rather than just specifying the Resources to return.

* *Alternative 2*: Choosing which Resource to return based on User ID only
** Advantages: Less user input is required to return Resources.
** Disadvantages: Returning Resources will take a longer period to search all Reservations, and the user has less flexibility in returning Resources.

=== List

Implemented by: Aarushi +
Written by: Aarushi

Listing resources using RIMS is facilitated by the ListCommand, after receiving input from the user in the Ui and being passed through Parser. There are three different ways resources can be listed: all items listed, by room, or by item.

.Sequence Diagram for Listing all Resources
[caption="Figure 2.4.1: "]
image::ListAllResourcesSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

For listing all resources(as shown in Figure 2.4.1), consider the case where the user wants a list of all the resources due in the inventory:

1.	When starting up RIMS, a Ui and Parser object is instantiated respectively.
2.	Referring to Figure 2.4.1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting for input from the user. He/She types the relevant input to the Ui object (getInput() function).
3.	This input is received by the Parser object, which contains the relevant parameters.
4.	Following that, the Parser object constructs a new ListCommand with the evaluated parameters.
5.	Afterwards, the ListCommand is executed with the execute() function for QTY = resource.size(), which is the number of items in the ResourceList.
6.	Lastly, the Ui object prints a list of all the resources in the ResourceList line by line within the loop.

.Sequence Diagram for Listing one type of Resource
[caption="Figure 2.4.2: "]
image::ListRoomOrItemSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

For listing resources by item/room(as shown in Figure 2.4.2), consider the case where the user wants a list of all the dates a specific room/item is booked on:

1.	When starting up RIMS, a Ui and Parser object is instantiated respectively.
2.	Referring to Figure 2.4.2, a parseInput() function is called, prompting for input from the user. He/She types the relevant input to the Ui object (getInput() function).
3.	This input is received by the Parser object, which contains the relevant parameters, such as whether the resource the user wants to check is an Item or a Room(the Parser object also prompts for new input from user should the format be incorrect or if the resource does not exist).
4.	Following that, the Parser object constructs a new ListCommand with the evaluated parameters.
5.	Afterwards, the ListCommand is executed with the execute() function for QTY times, which is the number of that particular item/room in the ReservationList.
6.	Lastly, the Ui object prints a list of all the dates that resource is booked on in the ReservationList line by line within the loop.

=== Calendar

Implemented by: Daniel +
Written by: Daniel

==== Implementation
.Sequence Diagram for Calendar
[caption="Figure 2.5: "]
image::CalendarSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

Viewing the resources on loan in a particular month, in the form of a calendar visualisation, is achieved using CalendarCommand. It extends Command and stores the necessary attributes and methods necessary to print to screen, a visualisation of the data.

The user will input the command: cal in the UI. This is then parsed by Parser to invoke the constructor of CalendarCommand.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how CalendarCommand works:

1.	When RIMS launches, a UI and Parser object is instantiated.
2.	Referring to Figure 2.5, a parseInput() function is called, prompting the user to input a command. The user enters a desired command, such as cal, into the UI.
3.	This input is received by the Parser and it will call the constructor in CalendarCommand.
4.	CalendarCommand is executed where getData() and printCal() is called.
5.	getData() will fetch data from ResourceList using the List() function. It will iterate through all the days of the current month and store it in an array.
6.	printCal() will draw the grid with dates and entries using the data obtained from getData().

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect: How entries is obtained_

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: A 2-dimensional array is created to store all entries of the month to be called later.
** Advantages: Performance is optimised as memoization will allow faster access of entries when the calendar is printed line by line in future
** Disadvantages: Requires more space to store entries
* *Alternative 2*: The function list() is called every time an entry is printed
** Advantages: Does not require as much space at the first alternative as the data is discarded after every row of a cell is printed
** Disadvantages: Will result in taking more time to print out the whole calendar if the data is big. This is because list() has to be called for every line on every cell(day) of the calendar as opposed to calling list() once for every cell(day).
