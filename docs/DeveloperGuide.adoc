By: `Team W17-4`      Since: `Aug 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites
. *JDK `11`* or above +
[NOTE]
The `oof.jar` file is compiled using the Java version mentioned above. +
. *IntelliJ* IDE
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed.
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer
. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run `oof.Oof` and try a few commands
. Run tests to ensure they all pass. _(coming soon)_
