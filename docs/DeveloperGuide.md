### 1. Setting Up

- see the Guide [Here]() 

### 2. Design 

#### 2.1  Architecture

![architecture]( https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main1/blob/master/docs/images/arch.png )

`main` has 1 class called `Duke`. It is responsible for,

- at app launch: Loads all the data in storage into the application, initialize the  components, reads the commands and executes them correctly.
- at shut down: shuts down all component and exits the application

The Application consist of 10 other components 

- `command`: executes the command that is read from the user
  - `dishesCommand`
  - `orderCommand`
  - `ingredientCommand`
- `exception`: handle error messages
- `dish`: contains the dishlist as well the the dish class 
- ` Fridge` : contains 
- `ingredient`: contains ingredient list 
- `list`: a class which contains a generic list. this list is used by various other classes
- `order`:  contains the order class
- `parser`: determine the next course of action from the user command
- `storage`: Reads, writes data from and to the hard disk
- `ui`: The UI of the application, manages the IO 

![sequence]( https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main1/blob/master/docs/images/UMLsequence.png )

The diagram above shows the program sequence when the user enters the command `todo buy eggs` or `list`. 

#### 2.2 UI


API: `Ui.java`

The Ui class manages the Input/Output interactions with the user. It consists of methods that allow reading the user input from the console and printing messages to the user as a response to the specific commands read.

The Ui component contains all the messages or replies whenever the User enters a command, for example if the user, while in the dish mode, enters:

`add chicken rice`

`remove 1`

The Ui will be used to reply to the User with the following messages:

`ui.showAddedDishes(String)`

`ui.showDeletedDish(String)`

```
	 ____________________________________________________________
	 you have added the following dish: 
	 chicken rice 
	 ____________________________________________________________
```

```
	 ____________________________________________________________
	 The following dish have been removed:
	 chicken rice
	 ____________________________________________________________
```
the `Ui` also consist of templates for the different sections of the program, such as a template for dish, orders and ingredient

<u>Ingredient</u> 

```
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
         Continue by adding, removing or using an ingredient(using its index number).
         Template:
         _________________________________________________________________________________________
         add <Ingredient name> <amount> <expiry date: DD/MM/YYYY>
         remove <ingredient number>
         use <ingredient name> <amount> *always use most recently expiring ingredients 			 first, to prevent food waste!*
         To change amount, changeamount <Ingredient's Index> <New amount>
	 	 To change name, changename <Ingredient's Index> <New name>
	 	 To find an ingredient, find <Ingredient name>
```

<u>Order</u>

```
       _______________________________________________________________________________
    	     ___   _______     ______   ________  _______
    	   .'   `.|_   __ \   |_   _ `.|_   __  ||_   __ \    
    	  /  .-.  \ | |__) |    | | `. \ | |_ \_|  | |__) |   
    	  | |   | | |  __ /     | |  | | |  _| _   |  __ /    
    	  \  `-'  /_| |  \ \_  _| |_.' /_| |__/ | _| |  \ \_
    	   `.___.'|____| |___||______.'|________||____| |___|
    
    
    	 Managing order now
    	 Type 'template' to retrieve command format
    	 _______________________________________________________________________________
```

<u>Dish</u>

```
_________________________________________________________________________________________
         Continue by adding, removing, listing, adding ingredient and initializing
         Template:       _________________________________________________________________________________________
         add <dish name>
         remove <dish index>
         list
         ingredient <description> <amount> <index>
         initialize (REMOVES all entries in the list)
         back, return to main menu
         template     _________________________________________________________________________________________
```

The `Ui` class consists of methods that outputs messages to the user as a response when the user enters a certain command

- reads and returns the user input by using `scanner.nextLine()`, where `scanner` is a `java.util.Scanner` Object
- allows for user/app dialogs, by using the methods such as `showDialogAddingExpired()` , used when the user tries to add an expired ingredient. Namely, the user is prompted if he whishes to continue with adding an expired Ingredient, and upon receiving the user response, by using the `readCommand()` method, a suitable response is printed on the console
- outputs messages to the user as a response such as `showRemovedIngredient(String,Int)` and `showAddOrder(String,Int)`, etc
- consist of diagrams of the different templates

#### 2.3 Command Component

![Command]( https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main1/blob/master/docs/images/Command.png )

Figure. Structure of the Command Component

API: `Command.java`

`Duke` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user input and retrieves the useful information contained in the user input, and call a specific `Command` to be executed. The command execution may affect the content of `OrderList`, `Fridge`, `DishList` or `TodayTodoList`,  and their correspinding storages. The command execution may also show the user the respond to the query, or exit the program.

In `Command` Component, there are three types of commands: `Ingredient Command`, `Dishes Command`, `Order Command`, which are packaged separately, as commands in the same package may share same list of things and storage. The three packages and the classes in them are listed as below:

- dishesCommand
  - AddDishCommand
  - DeleteDishCommand
  - ListDishCommand
  - InitCommand
  - AddIngredient
- orderCommand
  - AddOrderCommand
  - AlterDateCommand
  - CancelOrderCommand
  - DoneOrderCommand
  - InitOrderListCommand
  - ListOrderCommand
- ingredientCommand
  - AddCommand
  - DeleteCommand
  - FindIngredientCommand
  - FindToday
  - ListCommand
  - RemoveAllExpired
  - UseCommand
  - ChangeAmountCommand
  - ChangeNameCommand

The `Command` class is used as an abstract class for other command classes, its method `execute` is also declared as an abstract method, as shown in the figure above. Any other command classes all inherit from `Command` class and override the implementation of the `execute` method. 

#### 2.4 Parser Component

API: `Parser.java`

makes sense of the data that is read by the user from the Duke Class. 

this component gets the command from the user through the Duke Class. This component will then make sense of the command by splitting the command into different parts as well as determining the command type.

![Parser](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main/blob/master/docs/images/Parser.png)

| methods                           | description                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| parse(String,Type)                | to differentiate the type of command from user    |
| order(String)                     | method to execute different order commands        |
| dish(String)                      | method to execute different dish commands         |
| ingredient(String)                | method to execute different ingerdient commands   |
| checkLength(String[])             | checks length of the user command                 |
| parseInt(String,int)              | ensure that int is more the 0 and less than limit |
| checkInt(String)                  | ensure that int is more the 0 and less than limit |
| addOrderDateParser(String[])      | returns AddOrderCommand()                         |
| alterOrderDateParser(String[])    | returns AlterDateCommand()                        |
| cancelOrDoneOrderParser(String[]) | return DoneOrderCommand() or CancelOrderCommand() |

firstly the full command read from the user will go through parse method. depending on the the type, it will either return order, dish or ingredient commands. in the order, dish and ingredient methods, the content of the splitted value class will execute different commands.

#### 2.5 Storage Component

##### 2.5.1 Storage

![Storage]( https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main1/blob/master/docs/images/storage.png )

Figure. Structure of the Storage Component

API: `Storage.java` 

This component handles storing data and reading it from text files on the hard disc. Upon creation, instances of its subtypes get linked to a *.txt* file passed as an argument in the constructor (by specifying its file path). Subsequently, this specific text file is used for loading and storing data.

 `Storage.java`  is modelled as a *generic, abstract* component, used as a base for the `FridgeStorage.java` , `OrderStorage.java` and `RecipeStorage.java`, each one having their own implementation of the *abstract* method `generate()`, that creates and returns a `GenericList` from the entries stored in the .txt file liked to them. 

This component  allows for storing entries in a certain format, by using the `printInFile()` methods of  these `Printable` entries. Some examples of the data to be stored, are dishes in the dish list, ingredients that are already in the fridge, recipes in the Recipe book and anything else that needs to be saved on the hard disk and available again upon rebooting the program.

The dynamic change in the text file contents during execution, is handled primarily by the `update()` method. Calling this method results in updating the content in the linked text file accordingly to the entries in the `GenericList` contained in, and used by that component.

The program can `load` or `generate` an entry from the storage, and offers the methods to `changeContent(int index)`,  `addInFile(String data)` and `removeFromFile(int index)`.

The interactions between the `GenericList` and the `Storage` and their subclasses is shown in the figure below.

<img src="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main/blob/master/docs/images/StorageUML.png" style="zoom:50%" />

##### 2.5.2 FridgeStorage

API: `FridgeStorage.java` 

A subclass of  `Storage.java`, used for storing and loading `Ingredient`s from the `Fridge`. It contains an `IngredientList` , as a `GenericList` of  `Ingredient`s, to keep track of the entries/ingredients being stored, loaded, and  dynamically changed during the program execution. The Ingredients are saved by using the format specified by their `printInFile()` method. The text file linked to this component is *"fridge.txt"*.

The format that print in file follows is  `ingredient_name|ingredient_amount|ingredient_expiry date` . See the example below as printed in the `fridge.txt` file during the program execution:

```
milk|3|09/09/2019
cheese|4|12/12/2019
rice|50|12/12/2019
```

Calling the `load()` method on the text file above, would result in an `IngredientList` containing the four ingredients with their respective amounts and expiry dates.

##### 2.5.3 OrderStorage

API: `OrderStorage.java`

A subclass of  `Storage.java`, that can store `orders` in the order list in a certain format, by storing it into and reading it back from the `order.txt` file stored on the hard disc. The `OrderList` as a `GenericList` of orders also changes dynamically with the program execution.The format print in file follows  `order_status|serving_date|D|dish_name|dish_amount|D|dish_name|dish_amount|...` , where status refers to `done(1)`/`undone(0)`, and `D` seperates each ordered dishes with its amount. See example below:

```
1|02/11/2019|D|fish|1|D|chili crab|1|D|rice|2
0|12/11/2019|D|beef noodle|1|D|pork dumplings|2
0|11/11/2019|D|cereal shrimp|1|D|soup|4
```

##### 2.5.4 DishStorage

API: `RecipeStorage.java`

A subclass of  `Storage.java`, that can store `dishes` in the recipebook in a certain format, by storing it into and reading it back from the `recipebook.txt` file stored on the hard disc. The `DishList` as a `GenericList` of dishes also changes dynamically with the program execution. The format print in file follows:

  ```
cake|milk|3|sugar|2|egg|1|wheat|3
pumpkin pie|pumpkin|1|sugar|1|egg|1
cookie|wheat|2|cocoa beans|1
golden apple|gold ingot|8|apple|1
  ```

##### 2.5.5 Printable


<img src="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main/blob/master/docs/images/Printable.png" style="zoom:25%" />

Figure. Structure of Printable

API: `Printable.java` 

It models a *public* *Interface*, implemented by all the classes that have the feature to print their representation in a file. 

Offers one abstract method `printInFile()` whose implementation should indicate the format of printing the representation of the specific object calling it. A UML Class Diagram is shown above.

#### 2.6 List Component


<img src="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main/blob/master/docs/images/GenericListUML.png" style="zoom:25%" />

Figure. Structure of the List Component

API: `GenericList.java` 

This *generic, abstract* class `GenericList.java` allows for the creation of different types of lists, and basic list entry manipulations. It is extended by multiple classes, including `IngredientsList.java`, `OrderList.java` and `DishList.java`. The three classes inherit the basic methods from the `GenericList` class and extend it with their own specific methods (e.g. `getAllUndoneOrders()` in`OrderList` class,  `changeAmount()` in `IngredientsList` class), as shown in the UML Class Diagram above.

##### 2.6.1 IngredientList

##### 2.6.2 OrderList

API: `OrderList.java` 

Child class of `GenericList` , using the `Order` as a generic type. Inherits and further extends the attributes and methods of this superclass. 

Below are tables of the attributes and the methods implemented in `OrderList` class.

| Atrributes              | Decription                                                |

###### 2.6.2.1 TodayTodoList

As seen in the attributes of `OrderList` class, there is one attribute `todoList`. Its type is `TodayTodoList`. `TodayTodoList` is not a child of `GenericList` since today todo list varies a lot from day to day. There is no need to read out of and write into the hard disk. The `todoList` will be updated when the program starts, by parsing todo dishes from the order list. The `todoList` may also change with the changes of orders in the order list.

To look into the `TodayTodoList` class, it has private field tasks which consisting of dishes and the amount of the dishes need to be finished today.

Below are tables of the attributes and the methods implemented in `TodayTodoList` class.

| Atrributes                   | Decription                                                   |

| toString(): String         | Return the content of the todo list as string                |

##### 2.6.3 DishList

API: `DishList.java` 

This class inherits from the `GenericList` class  which takes in a List of `Dish`. this class holds all the dishes that is stored in the csv file thus this acts as a menu for the chef

Below is a table of the methods implemented in this class.

| Constructor          | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| DishList(List<Dish>) | assigns a list of dishes to dishList             |
| DishList()           | assigns an empty ArrayList<>() to dishList       |
| toString(): String   | returns all the dishes in the dishList in String |

#### 2.7 Exception Component

API: `DukeException.java`

whenever the program runs into an error, an exception will be thrown notifying the user that they may have entered an invalid command.

eg. `throw new DukeException("enter a valid amount/index")`

`DukeException` will print out:

```
	 OOPS!!! enter a valid amount/index 
	 You can type: 
	 'template' to see the format of the commands, 
	 'back' to see all your options, 
	 'q' to exit
```



#### 2.8 Dish Component

API: `Dish.java`

![dishes](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113-T14-2/main/blob/master/docs/images/dishes.PNG)

**<u>Dish Class</u>**

This class holds the name of the dish as well the ingredients that are associated to that specific dish.  there are several methods the Dish class contains that allows the attributes to be modified.

| Attributes                       | Description                                     |

| printInFile():String                | formats dish andingredient list for writing into file        |
| toString(): String                  | it returns a String of all the ingredients that the dish contains |


#### 2.9 dishesCommand Component

API: `addDishCommand.java` `addIngredient.java` `deleteDishCommand.java` `ListDishCommand.java` `ResetDishCommand.java` `FindDishCommand.java` `ChangeDishCommand.java`

The dishesCommand component  enables the chef to modify the dishList which acts as a menu or recipebook. this component inherits from other classes. 

AddDishCommand, AddIngredient, DeleteDishCommand, ListDishCommand, ResetDishCommand, FindDishCommand and ChangeDishCommand inherits from the Command class

- **<u>AddDishCommand</u>**
  
  user intends to add a dish to the dishList. this command takes in a description which is the dish name. user enters the command `addish chicken rice` which denotes adding the dish called chicken rice into the dishList. the program will enter the AddDishCommand class and executes the method below.
  
  If the dishList is empty(size of dishList is 0), immediately add the dish into the dishList. however, if the dishList is not empty, the program will need to go through the entire dishList to check if the dish has already been added. this is done so that there are no duplicate dishes.
  
  once the dish is added to the dishList, the method will use the Ui class with method call ui.showAddedDishes() as a reply to the user that the dish has been successfully added into the list.
  
- **<u>AddIngredient</u>**

  user intends to add an ingredient to a certain dish in dishList. this command takes in a description which is the ingredient name, amount and index. thus user enters `ingredient rice 100 1` which denotes adding an ingredient called rice with a amount of 100g to the index of the dish. in this case the index is 1. this command will then call the method`addIngredient` from the Dish class. in this method, it will iterate through the ingredient list to check for duplicates. if there are duplicates, same name and same amount, notify the user that the ingredient already exist. if the name of the ingredient is the same but amount is different, it only change the amount to the new amount. 

  if any of the description is empty, an exception will be thrown to inform the user. 

- **<u>DeleteDishCommand</u>**

  user intends to remove a dish in dishList. thus user enters `remove 1` which denotes removing a dish of index 1 from the dishList. this command takes in an integer index and the command will remove dish from dishList by the given index. 

  if there is no such dish with user keyed index, an exception will be thrown to the user.

- **<u>ResetDishCommand</u>**

  user intends to clear the dishList. thus user enters `initialize` which will clear the dishList

- **<u>ListDishCommand</u>**

  user intends to list all the dishes in the dishList. user needs to enter `list` for the program to list all the dishes in the dishList. for each dish in the list, there are also ingredients associated to it. hence, this command prints all the dishes as well as the ingredients associated to it.
  
- **<u>FindDishCommand</u>**

  user intends to find a dish in the dishList by keyword. user enters `find rice`, which denotes to list all the dishes which has the string rice in the name. this command takes in a String keyword and it will iterate through the dishList to find all the dishes that contain the keyword given by user. 

  it will then print out the dish as well as the ingredient list of the dish to the user.

- **<u>ChangeDishCommand</u>**

  user intends to change the name of the dish. user needs to enter `change 1 chicken noodle` which denotes changing name if dish at index 1 to chicken noodle. this command takes in an integer index and string which is the new dish name. it will then change the name of the dish in dishList by the index to the new name.

#### 2.10 Order Component
API: `Order.java`

The order component manage orders in a well-organized way. It stores a list of dishes. Each dishes is stored as format of a map of (key, value) where key refers to the dishes name and the value refers to its total ordered amount in the placing order. The order content may vary according to operations such as addition, cancellation, alteration, marking as done. The order content supports view by specifying requirements.

Besides, we assume that the dishes in chef's todo list should be finished by the end of "today". At the beginning of each day, the todo list will be initialized. However, the order supports pre-order, allowing the order date is not today. That is, the initialization of chef's todo list might not be empty, which leads to its two constructor methods.

Below are tables of the attributes and some methods implemented in `Order` class.

| Attributes                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| content: Map<String, Integer> | the content of the order, specifying ordered dishes and amount |
| isDone: boolean               | the status of the order: *true* if done, *false* otherwise   |
| date: Date                    | the serving date of the order (not the date when the order was created) |
| dateToString: String          | the serving date of the order as string                      |

| Methods                      | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| isToday(): boolean           | returns a `boolean` indicating whether the serving date is today or not |
| isDone(): boolean            | returns a `boolean` indicating whether the order is finished or not |
| markAsDone(): void           | mark the order as finished                                   |
| toString(): String           | returns description of the order as `String`                 |
| printInFile(): String        | returns description of the order that used to store in the txt file |
| hasDishes(Dishes): boolean   | returns a `boolean` indicating whether the order has the dishes or not |
| getDishesAmount(Dishes): int | returns the amount of the query dishes in the order          |
| addDish(Dishes): void        | add one more the dishes to the undone order                  |
| addDish(Dishes, int): void   | add the dishes to the undone order with adding amount        |

#### 2.11 Order Command Component

API: `AddOrderCommand.java`, `AlterDateCommand.java`, `DeleteOrderCommand.java`, `DoneOrderCommand.java`, `ListOrderCommand.java`

The Order Command classes inherits from the `Command` class. They overwrite the abstract method `execute` of the `Command` class. The Order Command classes includes:

- `AddOrderCommand`: This command will add order to the orderlist and update the chef's todo list. The order can be loaded manually by command. The order can also be read from the file when initializing -- which is the case of the pre-order.
- `AlterDateCommand`: This command will change the serving date of the order. If it changed to the date of today, then chef's todo list should be updated. If it changed to the date before today, then the change is considered invalid.
- `CancelOrderCommand`: This command is used for cancelled orders. It also synchronizes with chef's todo list.
- `DoneOrderCommand`: This command is used for changing the status of the order to be finished. The done dishes in the order can be removed from the chef's todo list. 
- `ListOrderCommand`: The command is to list all orders or is to list orders after filtering. The filter feature can be date, dishes, order status.
- `InitOrderCommand`: [*DANGEROUS*] This command will empty all the orders in the order list.

#### 2.12 Fridge Component
API: `Fridge.java` ,`Ingredient.java`

The `Fridge` component allows access and modification of the `Ingredient`s used by the chef. By keeping track of the Ingredients' expiry date, it allows the user to know which products have expired, and remove them. The ingredients are always kept sorted by their expiry date, with the most recently expiring  ingredients coming first. Hence, this allows for less ingredient waste, as it can return the most recently expiring ingredients, so that they can be used first.  

Upon (re)booting the program, the `Fridge` gets initialized with the current `IngredientList` (the attribute `entries`) stored in the `FridgeStorage`, passed as a parameter to it's main constructor. In all subsequent Ingredient manipulations, these two components are accessing/modifying the same `IngredientList`, meaning modifications made in the `Fridge`, are immediately seen in the `entries` attribute (an inherited `GenericList`) of the `FridgeStorage` , therefore, consistency among these classes is guaranteed.

#### 2.13 ingredientCommand Component

API: `AddCommand.java`, `DeleteCommand.java`, `FindToday.java`, `ListCommand.java`, `RemoveAllExpired.java`, `FindIngredientCommand.java`, `UseCommand.java`, `ChangeAmountCommand.java`, `ChangeNameCommand.java`

The `ingredientCommand` classes all inherit from the `Command` class. They all have a specific implementation of the abstract method `execute` of the class `Command`. The `ingredientCommand` classes includes:

- **AddCommand** This command adds an `Ingredient` to the `Fridge` passed as an argument upon creating this command.  When adding an `Ingredient`, it is compared to all the existing ingredients in the `Fridge`, if there is an match, having the same name and expiry date, no new entry is created in the `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`, namely, only the amount of the already existing matching ingredient is augmented by the amount of the `Ingredient` to be added. Otherwise, a new `Ingredient` entry is created in the `IngredientList`. 
- **DeteleCommand**: This command deletes an `Ingredient` from the `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`. The `Ingredient` to be removed is indicated by it's index in the `IngredientList`, passed as a parameter when creating this command. 
- **FindToday**: This command is used to look for expired ingredients from the `IngredientsList` of the `Fridge`, on the date itself.
- **ListCommand**: This command is used to show the chef's entire `IngredientsList`.
- **RemoveAllExpired**: The command is used to remove all expired ingredients from the  `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`.
- **FindIngredientCommand**: This command is used to find all the `Ingredient`, with the queried keyword entered by the chef, in the `Fridge`.
- **UseCommand**: This command is executed to use and remove the specified amount of a **non-expired** `Ingredient` stored in the  `IngredientList` of the `Fridge`, when the Chef wants to use it. An important *note* is that ingredients are used based on their expiry date, meaning the **most recently expiring ingredients**, matching the ingredient name indicated by the chef, **are used first**. Otherwise, if there is not enough of the required non-expired amount of this ingredient needed by the chef, the program will output a message notifying the Chef. 
- **ChangeAmountCommand**: This command is used to change the amount of an `Ingredient` given the index number of the `Ingredient`.
- **ChangeNameCommand**: This command is used to change the name of an `Ingredient` given the index number of the `Ingredient`.


### 3. Implementation

##### 3.1 Proposed `UseCommand` Implementation, *preventing food waste*:

This Command is implemented, such that it makes use of the `IngredientList`'s method for removing a specific amount from an `Ingredient`, namely,  `removeEntry(Ingredient ingredient)`. At every moment the ingredients kept in the `Fridge` are sorted by their expiry date. This method will loop trough all of the ingredients stored (in a sorted order, checking most recently expiring ingredients first), that have the same name as the ingredient to be used, and only taking the non-expired ingredients. It works by keeping a local `integer` counter that indicates the needed amount of the ingredient at each moment of the execution. Each time that there is a match, the needed amount is checked against the amount contained in the match, **if the needed amount is greater than the amount contained in the matched ingredient**, the needed amount is decreased by the amount contained in the match, the match is removed from the `IngredientList`, and the loop continues executing by finding the next match in the `IngredientList`. **Otherwise**, the amount of the match is decreased by the needed amount, and if it has reached zero, this ingredient is removed from the `IngredientList`, the method will return **true**, and the `UseCommand` will finish execution successfully, by showing a success message for the user. If all of the ingredients were checked and the needed amount was not satisfied, the `removeEntry` method will  return **false**, and the `UseCommand` will transfer this information to the user, indicating there is not a sufficient amount of this ingredient in the `Fridge`.

Assuming the Fridge initially contains the 5 Ingredients: 

1. pepper(amount 2, expired 10/11/2019)
2. rice(amount 100, expiring 12/2/2020)
3. pepper(amount 3, expiring 12/3/2020)
4. chicken (amount 3, expiring 12/3/2020)
5. pepper (amount 3, expiring 14/3/2020)

Upon typing `use pepper 5`, the `UseCommand` is created with the parameter `Ingredient` having the name `pepper` and amount `5`. Calling execute on this command will remove the third entry - *pepper(amount 3, expiring 12/3/2020)*, and decrease the amount of the last entry by two, `5 - 3 => 2` , so the entry remains, now having a total amount of one. 

This will result in the following `IngredientList` being stored in the Fridge:

1. pepper(amount 2, expired 10/11/2019)
2. rice(amount 100, expiring 12/2/2020)
3. chicken (amount 3, expiring 12/3/2020)
4. pepper (amount 1, expiring 14/3/2020)
