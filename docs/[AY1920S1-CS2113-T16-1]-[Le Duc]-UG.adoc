== Introduction

Le Duc ("The Duke" in French) is for students who have both academic and extracurricular lives and have to manage them both. Outside, they have to go to school, work part-time, attend club and have fun at some party. At home, they have to do homework, undertake a project, do some chore, cook some nice food. Pretty busy, right ? With this new tool, a student can manage and organise his time more efficiently.

- DESCRIPTION: The description of the task
- WELCOME: the welcome message
- INDEX is the index of the task (goes from 1 to the number of tasks). You can find the index of the task by showing all the task with the command list of by searching the task with the command find.
- KEYWORD: the keyword to find a task.

====

=== Viewing all the command: `help`

To show the list of all command : `help`

=== Adding a task (`todo` - `deadline` - `event`)

==== Adding a todo task:

- Then, enter the new DESCRIPTION or the new DATE of the task

=== Sort by (not implemented yet)

Sort all task by date/description: `sort SORTTYPE`

SORTTYPE is either date, description, priority

Be careful:

* Sorting by date is from the sooner to the later
* Sorting by description is sorting the description by alphabetical order
* Sorting by priority is from the most urgent one to the less urgent one

=== Prioritize (not implemented yet)

Giving priority to task: `prioritize INDEX prio INDEX`

The first INDEX is the task index

The second INDEX is the priority (goes from 0 to 9)

Be careful:

* The second INDEX can’t be less than 0 and more than 9
* 0 is the less urgent, 9 is the most urgent
* When creating a task, you can either specify the priority or not. When the priority is not specified, the task will have a priority of 5.

=== Display by day/week/month (not implemented yet)

Display all the task for one particular day/week/month: `display date DATETYPE DATE`

DATETYPE is day, week, month.

DATE is

* a date for the DATETYPE day
* the first date of the week for the DATETYPE week
* a month and the year for the DATETYPE month

Be careful:

* DATE must be in dd/MM/yyyy format for the DATETYPE day and week
* DATE must be in MM/yyyy format for the DATETYPE month

=== Create task list (not implemented yet)

Create a different task list: `tasklist DESCRIPTION`

DESCRIPTION is the name of the new tasklist

Be careful:

* The first tasklist will be name main task list, except if it is edited (can’t be done for the moment)
* Each new tasklist will have an index automatically

=== Display different task list (not implemented yet)

Display different task list, for example one task list for school, one task list for work: `display tasklist INDEX`.

INDEX is the task list index (if exist)


=== Shortcut  (not implemented yet)

Give shortcut to command : `shortcut`

For each command, the console will output the command name.

The user (you) have to input the shortcut you want.

If the shortcut already exist, the console will tell you to assign another shortcut

=== Import other task list (not implemented yet)

If the user want to import another task list: `Import FILENAME`.

The FILENAME is path to the file

Be careful:

* The file must be in the same format as every file in the project
* The file must be in the directory data

=== Subtask (not implemented yet)

You can create a subtask of another task: when creating the task, just add `sub INDEX` at the end.
