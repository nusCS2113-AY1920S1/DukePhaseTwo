=== Project: RIMS – Resource & Inventory Management System

This portfolio documents my contributions to the RIMS project, in terms of coding contributions towards implementing main features, project management on GitHub, and written contributions towards the User Guide, Developer Guide and general documentation.

== About the project ==

RIMS (Resource & Inventory Management System) is a command-line based logistics management system, designed to keep track of an organisation’s facilities and inventory. To this end, the application supports the addition and deletion of resources from an organisation’s inventory, and tracks the loaning out and general status of items and facilities in the inventory. The program is intended to be used by logistical administrators or managers, for whom RIMS can act as a digital ledger of the resources moving in and out of their inventory.

This is what our project looks like:

image::images/Ui.png[550, 600]

.*Main features of RIMS*
* Addition and deletion of items and rooms from the inventory
* Allows the user to track the lending out and booking of resources to those requesting the loan
* Allows the user to track the reservation of items and rooms between two future dates
* Provides reminders when items or rooms are overdue for return
* View current bookings and reservations in a calendar format

The following sections will summarize my contributions to the implementation of these features, as well as my contributions to the documentation and project management process for this project.

.*Glossary*
* Item: an object in the user’s inventory. There can be multiple of one item in a user’s inventory (e.g. 5 pens)
* Room: a facility in the user’s inventory, of which there can only be one (e.g. seminar room 1)
* Resource: any item or room in the user’s inventory.
* User: the logistics administrator who is running the RIMS program.
* Requester: the person requesting to borrow a resource from the user’s inventory.

== Summary of contributions

- *Provided base code for majority of the program*

* Created the core classes required for accepting and processing user input, managing resources in the inventory, loading the current status of resources and reservations from the disk, and writing the logic for the program, which are fundamental for operation of the RIMS program
* Created the basic structure for all implemented commands, along with providing the basic implementation for adding and deleting resources, creating a user-viewable list of resources, and loaning and returning resources
* The features present in the RIMS program are all extensions of these core classes and commands  

- *Major enhancement: added the ability to loan out and reserve items and rooms*

* What it does: 
** The `loan` command allows the user to temporarily loan out a resource in the organisation’s inventory to a requester, from the time the loan request is registered in the RIMS program, to a user-specified date of return. 
** The `reserve` command allows the user to reserve a resource for the requester, between two future dates as specified by the requester.

* Justification:
** This feature enhances the effectiveness of RIMS as a digital inventory tracker for its intended audience of resource managers, for whom making and tracking loans are crucial responsibilities. Including this feature allows RIMS to further assist our intended audience by digitally keeping track of resources they have loaned out.

* Highlights:
** The implementation of this feature was challenging due to the need to check the availability of the resource being requested.
** The inventory had to be searched to check whether there was enough of that resource in the inventory to meet the requester’s demand, and whether those resources had not already been reserved for another requester.

- *Major enhancement: added a reminder of all resources that are due soon or overdue for return*

* What it does:
** When RIMS is started up, the program creates a list of loaned-out resources that are either due for return within 3 days, or overdue for return.

* Justification:
** This feature enhances the effectiveness of RIMS by letting the program remind the user of all the resources that he must ensure will be returned to him soon. This eases the burden of him having to manually type in multiple commands to check whether any of the various types of resources in the inventory are due for return soon.

* Highlights:
** The enhancement will be able to work with future changes to code and new features to be added.
** The enhancement also features an `[OVERDUE]` tag to distinguish resources that are already overdue, from resources that are due soon but not overdue yet.

- *Minor enhancement: allowing the return of multiple items simultaneously*

** Each requester has a unique ID by which they are identified
** When the command to return an item is called in the RIMS program, the program first asks for the ID of the requester who is returning their item
** The program then lists all the reservations and loans that have been made by that user, allowing them to select multiple reservations/loans to return simultaneously

== Contributions to the User Guide

Given below is an excerpt of the RIMS User Guide, featuring my contributions to the guide.

The excerpt describes the usage of the `loan` and `reserve` commands in RIMS, which are used to register the lending out of items in the user’s inventory.

=== Booking and returning resources

==== Loan out resources: `loan`
Registers a resource as having been loaned out, from the current date until a user-specified future date. The resource is thus unavailable for further loaning until it is returned.

.*Format*:
* `loan /item ITEM_NAME /qty QUANTITY /id USER_ID /by DEADLINE`
* `loan /room ROOM_NAME /id USER_ID /by DEADLINE`
... If the item or room does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... `QUANTITY` must be a positive integer above 0.
... `USER_ID` must be a non-negative integer, with a value of 0 and above.
... If either of these values specified are invalid, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... If the user requests a quantity that is greater than the existing amount of that item in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
... Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
... The deadline must be a valid date in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, for which the resource will be booked from the current date until the next Tuesday at the specified time.
... If the deadline specified is in an invalid format, the program will send an error message.

.*Examples*:
* `loan /item book /qty 5 /id 1 /by 23/11/2019 1500`
* `loan /room mpsh /id 2 /by Wednesday 1700`

==== Reserve resources: `reserve`
Registers a resource as having been reserved for use between two dates in the future. The resource is thus unable to be further loaned or reserved during that time period.

While loans take effect from the current date to a specified deadline, reservations specify a future time-frame between which a resource is to be loaned out.

.*Format*:
* `reserve /item ITEM /qty QUANTITY /id USER_ID /from BORROW_DATE /by DEADLINE`
* `reserve /room ROOM /id USER_ID /from BORROW_DATE /by DEADLINE`
... For logistical purposes, only a resource that is currently in the user's inventory (i.e. is not currently out on loan) can be reserved.
... If the item or room does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... Quantity must be a positive integer above 0.
... User ID must be a non-negative integer, with a value of 0 and above.
... If either of these values specified are invalid, the program will send an error message to the UI.
... If the user requests a quantity that is greater than the existing amount of that item in the inventory, the UI will send an error message to the user.
... Rooms are unique and thus do not require quantities.
... The date of borrowing, and the deadline date must be a valid date, either in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, where `Tuesday` can be replaced by any day of the user's choice and will obtain the next available instance of that day and time.
... If the deadline specified is in an invalid format, the program will send an error message.

.*Examples*:
* `reserve /item basketball /qty 1 /from 01/12/2019 2300 /to 03/12/2019 2300`
* `reserve /room basketball court /from Monday 1600 /to 20/11/2019 2300`


==== Return resources: `return`
Registers a resource that has been loaned or reserved as returned to the user's inventory, and is thus available to be loaned out or reserved again.

.*Format*:
* `return /id USER_ID`
====
* RIMS will display a list of all reservations made by the requester whose ID was specified in the previous input, and prompt the user to input the reservation IDs of the reservations to be marked as returned:
+
image:return.png[]
+
* Each reservation ID is denoted by square brackets `[]`.
* The reservation IDs inputted must be non-negative integers.
* If multiple resources are to be simultaneously deleted, the multiple reservation IDs must be separated from each other by a single whitespace character.
* If the ID(s) inputted by the user are invalid or are not amongst the reservation IDs displayed, the program will send an error message to the UI.
====
... The `return` command takes the resource borrower's individual ID as an argument.
... The user ID must be a non-negative integer.
... If the user whose ID was inputted has not made any reservations or loans, the program will print an error message to the UI.


.*Examples*:
* `return /item frisbee` -> `2`
* `return /room seminar room 1`


=== Retrieving resource information

==== List resources and their statuses: `list`
View all resources in the user's inventory, with a brief summary of currently available and booked resources. There is also an option to view a more detailed list of individual items and rooms, and to view the list of items available on a certain date.

.*Format*:
* `list`
... Generates a list of all resources, divided by resources which are currently available and resources which are currently booked.
* `list /item ITEM_NAME`
... Generates a list detailing the reservation status (booked or available) and the current reservations of all instances of the requested resource.
... If the item does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
* `list /room ROOM_NAME`
... Prints out the reservation status (booked or available) of the requested room, and if booked, prints out the details of the room's current reservation.
... If the item does not exist in the RIMS inventory, the program will send an error message to the UI.
* `list /date DATE`
... Generates a list of all available and booked resources on any specified date and time.
... The requested date `DATE` must be a valid date, either in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HHmm`, or in the example format `Tuesday HHmm`, where `Tuesday` refers to the next instance of Tuesday from the current date.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

Given below is an excerpt of the RIMS Developer Guide, featuring my contributions to the guide.

The excerpt describes the implementation and design considerations of the `loan` and `reserve` commands in RIMS.

=== Reserve/Loan

==== Implementation
.Sequence Diagram for Reserve
[caption="Figure 2.2.1: "]
image::ReserveSequence.png[width="1000", align="center"]

Making a reservation utilizes the following classes. The Parser and UI class will gather inputs from users. Then, these inputs will be used to create new reservation under the ReserveCommand class. New reservations are added to the ReservationList class under each Resource object.

For making a reservation, consider the case where a user wants to make reservation of an existing resource.
When starting up RIMS, a Ui and Parser object is instantiated respectively.

1. Referring to Figure 2.2.1, a parseInput() function is called, prompting for input from the user. He/She enters the relevant input which is gathered by getinput() from Ui object.
2. After selecting a type of Resource, The Ui object will display a list of all Resource belong to that type for the user to choose.
3. The user can then enter the name of the Resource they wish to make a reservation for.
4. Then, the user can choose a time period they wish to reserve.
5. Following that, the Parser object constructs a new ReserveCommand object with the evaluated parameters.
6. Afterwards, the ReserveCommand is executed with the execute() function, which constructs a new Reservation based on the parameters provided in ReserveCommand.
7. The execute() function checks if an object is available for loan. If no Resource object is available, then an exception is thrown.
8. If any Resource is available for loan, then a new reservation object will be instantiated and added to the ReservationList object belonging to this Resource.
9. Lastly, the Ui object prints a message to the user to notify him/her of the resources that have been added into RIMS.

==== Design Considerations

_Aspect 1: Selection of resource and quantity_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*:
User select in terms of the following sequence - resource type, resource name, resource quantity.
When each input is gathered, the ui class will feedback relevant information to help the user make decisions. In case of invalid input (such as invalid name), the parser will throw an exception and display an error message. Using this approach, users can only make one reservation for multiple resources of the same name at a time.
** Advantages: More user friendly as user only requires one single command to make reservations for multiple resources of the same name.
** Disadvantages: More difficult to catch exceptions. User also cannot select the exact resource they wish to borrow since resources are selected by a non-unique attribute.

* *Alternative 2 (Previous version)*:
User select in terms of the following sequence - resource type, resource id.
When parser starts gathering input, it will display a full list of all resources. User then select the resource to make a reservation for by entering a resource id. Using this approach, users can only make one reservation for one resource at a time.
** Advantages: Easy to handle command and catch exceptions.
** Disadvantages:
Less user friendly in handling bulk reservation as user has to repeatedly enter the same command multiple times.
Less user friendly when the resource list becomes long. Users then have to manually find a resource ID

_Aspect 2: Selection of reservation dates_

* *Alternative 1 (Current choice)*:
User enters a single pair of start date followed by an end date. These pair of dates will be checked in the ReserveCommand class.

** Advantages:
-

** Disadvantages:
Users may need to key in repeated commands if they wish to make different reservations for a resource.

* *Alternative 2*:
Users are able to enter a list of pairs of start date followed by an end date. These pair of dates will be checked in the ReserveCommand class

** Advantages:
More user friendly if users wish to make different reservations for a resource.

** Disadvantages:
-
