2. Download the latest version of `COMPal.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W17-1/main/releases).

3. Copy the `COMPal.jar` file to the folder that you want to use as the home folder for **COMPal**.

6. **COMPal** will then ask if you have entered your name correctly. If you have, then type `Yes` in the **command box** and press the <button>Enter</button> key. If not, please type `No` and press the <button>Enter</button> key, and **COMPal** will repeat step 5.

7. And that's it! Initialisation is complete and **COMPal** just became your newest friend / most awesome assistant. You can now try entering commands in the **command box** and press <button>Enter</button> to execute it. 

8. Some example commands you can try:
    * `clear` : clears all output in the **output box**. Use this if the **output box** becomes too cluttered after typing too many commands.
    * `deadline <task description> /date <date of deadline>` : adds a task with a deadline 
    * `event <task description> /date <date of event> /time <time of event>` : adds an event that occurs at a specific time on a specific date
    * `find <search term>` : find a certain task related to a search term.
    * `list` : displays the entire list of tasks stored in **COMPal**'s massive memory. However, if you have just downloaded **COMPal**, it's likely that **COMPal** will not display any tasks. 
    * `bye` : bid goodbye to **COMPal** and exit the program. See you soon!!
