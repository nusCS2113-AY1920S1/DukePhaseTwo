# Introduction
* ArchDuke is a desktop Project Manager application. It has a GUI for better visualisation of the Kanban board and tasks
, but most of the user interactions will happen using a Command Line Interface (CLI).
* The Kanban board will also be printed onto command line for users that favour the usage of a CLI interface compared
 to a GUI.
