# BetterDuke - A scheduler for students
**A desktop application that will help you manage your time and work**

![](docs/images/Ui.png)

## Motivation

When too much time is being used for a particular work, the work duration snowballs and there is not enough time for other activities.
Moreover, lessons take up most of the day and it makes us feel that there is not enough time to catch up and finish assignments.
This usually stems from poor time management and this application aims to tackle the aforementioned problems.

## Aim
To provide a platform to help users
* Better manage their school schedules.
* Remind users about upcoming tasks.
* Improve usersâ€™ work-life balance.

## Features

### Weekly tasking
In-app view where users can view their weekly schedules and allow them to plan and prepare ahead for their schedule.

### Interactive commands
A command input style for users to give instructions to the application for scheduling. Variations in response to users' input makes the application more interesting and engaging.

### Reminder for upcoming tasks 
A reminder to trigger forgetful users' memory about upcoming tasks so that they would remember complete their tasking or activity.
