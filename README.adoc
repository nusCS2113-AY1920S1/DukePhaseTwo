* This is a desktop application. It is targetted at NUS students who would like a helping hand in managing a busy school life -- from handling deadlines and keeping track of deliverables and important dates, to monitoring module updates and viewing grades breakdown for every module.
* It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java sample application intended for students learning Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming language.
