*WalletCLi* is a CLI (Command Line Interface) expenses/loans application that caters to NUS students who prefer to use a desktop application to manage their expenses/loans.

*WalletCLi* automatically creates an interface that allows users to interact with our application, and enables easy creation, editing and deleting of items.
Recurring expenses such as bills are taken into account within our unique recursion system.
Expenses and loans can then be efficiently managed via the intuitive category system.

*WalletCLi* is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and/or are learning to work more efficiently with CLI tools. Additionally, unlike traditional wallet applications, *WalletCLi* utilizes minimal resources on the userâ€™s machine while still allowing the user to view their expenses and loans swiftly and efficiently.
